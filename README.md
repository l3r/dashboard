# dashboard

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vzhong/dashboard.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vzhong/dashboard)

Dashboard provides utilities to make and visualize experiment logs. Yes, now you can run your experiments on your server and view your logs on your phone like you've always wanted.


## Reporting

```python
from dashboard import reporter
import numpy as np

r = reporter.Reporter()

for epoch in range(10):
    for i in range(5):
        metrics = {'loss': np.random.uniform(0, 1), 'f1': np.random.uniform(0, 1)}
        r.add(metrics)
    print(r.summary())  # prints {'loss': <average loss>, 'f1': <average f1>}
    r.clear()
```


## Writers

![Console writer](/screenshot/console.gif)

```python
from dashboard import writer
from time import sleep
import numpy as np
import random
random.seed()

console_writer = writer.ConsoleWriter()
file_writer = writer.FileWriter('foo.log')   # writes to 'foo.log'
for epoch in range(3):
    for i in range(2):
        metrics = {'f1': np.random.uniform(0, 1), 'iteration': i, 'epoch': epoch}
        console_writer.add(metrics)
        file_writer.add(metrics)
        sleep(0.5)

exp1_hyperparams = {'d_hid': 100, 'dropout': 0.5, 'model': 'foo'}
exp2_hyperparams = {'d_hid': 200, 'dropout': 0.3, 'model': 'bar', 'comment': 'hello world!'}
writer1 = writer.FirebaseWriter('myexp1', exp1_hyperparams, delete_existing=True)
writer2 = writer.FirebaseWriter('myexp2', exp2_hyperparams, delete_existing=True)
for i in range(5):
    writer1.add({'iteration': i, 'score': random.uniform(0, 10)})
    writer2.add({'iteration': i, 'score': random.uniform(0, 10)})
    print('wrote to firebase data from iteration {}'.format(i))
```

Note that in order for `FirebaseWriter` to work, you need to create a config file `~/.fb.config` like follows:

```json
{
  "email": "email for a user in your Firebase",
  "password": "password for the user in your Firebase",
  "secret": "some secret (you can put whatever you want)",
  "apiKey": "Firebase API key",
  "authDomain": "Firebase auth domain",
  "databaseURL": "Firebase database URL",
  "storageBucket": "Firebase storage bucket"
}
```

All of these come with your Firebase config, with the exception of `email` and `password` which correspond to a user that you create inside your Firebase (who has access to the database).


## Firebase Web Client

![Dashboard client](/screenshot/client.gif)

An example client operating off of my personal Firebase can be found in the `client` directory.

NOTE: You will **not** be able to read/write to the database with this client until you have done the following:

1. Create an app on Firebase and locate your config according to [this guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup).
2. Enable email accounts and create an account/password for `FirebaseWriter` according to [this guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/password-auth). Note that **you don't need to do this via Javascript**, instead, just go to your users tab in Firebase and create an account.
3. Create `~/.fb.config`, copying in your Firebase config from Step 1 and the account credentials from Step 2.
4. Copy in your Firebase config from Step 1 into `main.js`.

Once you have done so, you can launch the web server in one of the following ways.

### Hosting static webpages

You can host the web pages on your machine by launching a simple http server.

```bash
# this is assuming you are using python 3
cd client/public && python -m http.server 9090
```

You should now be able to visit [localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090).

### Hosting on Firebase

Follow [these instructions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart) to set up Firebase tools.
Remember that you will need to change `client/.firebaserc` to point to your own app.

Next, the following command will deploy your app and print out the hosted URL.

```bash
cd client && firebase deploy
```

### Static webpage

You can actually use a static web page! Just open `client/public/index.html`.


# Contribution

Pull requests are welcome!

The project is set up as follows:

- `dashboard` contains the Dashboard python package, whose installation script is `setup.py`.
- `tests` contains the unit tests for the python package, runnable via `python setup.py test`.
- `client` contains the Firebase app.
- `client/public` contains source code for the client, mostly written in very basic [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/).
